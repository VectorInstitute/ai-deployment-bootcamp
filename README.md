# AI Deployment Bootcamp

This repository houses the reference implementations for the AI Deployment Bootcamp.

## About

The AI Deployment Bootcamp aims to introduce the different elements and concepts of
a production model inferencing pipeline.

This repository contains reference implementations with terraform and python scripts
to make online (real-time) and offline (batch) pipelines in cloud providers, as well
as detailed instructions on how to upload models, configure and run the code,
as well as testing the pipelines.

## Repository Structure

- **reference_implementations/**: Reference Implementations are organized by cloud
provider. Each reference implementation has its own directory containing scripts,
terraform plans, and a README for guidance.
- **data/**: Includes sample datasets or links to datasets used in the bootcamp,
along with usage instructions. It also contains the implementation of dataset modules,
or anything related to that.


### Reference Implementations Directory

Each cloud provider covered in the bootcamp has a dedicated directory in the
`reference_implementations/` directory. In each directory, there is a README file
that provides an overview of the topic, prerequisites, and detailed instructions.

Here is the list of the covered cloud providers:
- [Google Cloud Provider (GCP)](reference_implementations/gcp)

## Getting Started

To get started with this bootcamp:
1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the cloud provider you are going to use
3. Follow the instructions in the README file.
